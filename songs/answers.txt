Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A: When we input such query:
    SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability)
    FROM songs;
we get the results of 0.65906, 0.48443 and 0.71646. This lets us conclude that the average song can be characterized as:
    - pretty energetic (result > 0.5),
    - of medium valence (neither sad nor happy, result close to 0.5) and
    - pretty danceable (result > 0.5).
I think this should result in 'aura' being a mix of orange and yellow.


Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A: We could imagine calculating weighted averages of energy, valence and danceability with weights being eg. number of playbacks of a particular song.
